# Computer Architecture Simulation Best Practices

This document is an attempt to collect knowledge of computer architecture simulation practices that can be used for program analysis, hardware design and next-generation development of computer systems.

## Computer Architecture Basics

Computer architecture at a high level can be described as "the internal organization of a computer in an abstract way; that is, it defines the capabilities of the computer and its programming model." [[1]][clements1992tpoch] It also includes the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) design, microarchitecture design and logic design and implementation [[2]][hennessy2011caaqa], [[3]][wikipediaca].
